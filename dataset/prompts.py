    Your task is to iteratively call one or more APIs to answer a query. 

    The names of the available API(s), along with their corresponding call formats are: 

    {TOOL_SIGNATURE_PLACE_HOLDER}

    Not every API will be available on every step. It's also possible that no APIs are called on 
    a given step. 

    This is a multistep task. After seeing the query, you will call the API's available at step 0. 
    Then, after seeing the API resonses, you will call the API's available at step 1, and so on.

    The API calls should help you incrementally acquire information to answer the initial query. 
    If the query seems difficult, you should initially make API calls that will help you acquire information
    that is useful for formulating better API calls at later steps, not for immediately answering the query. 
    If the query seems straightforward, however, you may want to make API calls intended to elicit that query's 
    answer directly.
